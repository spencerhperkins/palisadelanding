                <h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
                <p><strong>Spencer Perkins</strong> is an engineer by training, having studied mechanical engineering at Duke University. After patenting several inventions in college, he grew fascinated with intellectual property and its impact on innovation.</p>
                <p>Spencer went on to earn his law degree from Georgetown and practiced as a patent lawyer, where he saw firsthand the inefficiencies in our IP system. He believes that better information systems can yield better outcomes for inventors and investors alike.</p>
                <p>Motivated by this vision, Spencer left his legal career to work on Palisade full-time, building AI-native research tools to empower the next generation of innovators.</p>
